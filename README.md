## Introduction
CAT is a DeFi projects based on the high performance blcok chain EOS. The private key is burned and the contract code is open sourced. The project has no pre-mining, no founder shares, no VC interests.CAT uses TVI (Total Value Inflow) as the project value assessment. There is no pool of funds in the smart contract, so there is no need to worry about the security of funds. 90% of your invested assets will be automatically returned to your EOS account, and 10% will be donated for subsequent development and operation.

## Roadmap
- CAT will be officially launched nearly at 2020-10-17 20:00:00(CST), please pay attention to the official lunch time.
- After one week of mining CAT, FISH liquidity pool will be deployed, which will empower CAT and FISH, it will contains CAT single mining pool, FISH single mining pool and other LP minig pools. Also there won't be any assets staked in pools to ensure 100% security.
- Within one week after FISH liquidiy mining launching, a game project will be deployed to empower CAT and FISH. The game is currently confidential and is in the final test procedure, which will include NFT.

## Security

### No pool of funds
CRT uses the TVI model as a project value assessment, and will not lock any funds in the contract, so it can ensure the 100% security of the contract.

### Private keys burned
CRT has given the authority to the system account `eosio.null`, the project has no control and cannot update the contract.

### How to verify the contract

- EOSIO Version: 2.0.5
- EOS.CDT Version: 1.7.0
